# TinyssimoRadar

TinyssimoRadar proposes a low-power in-ear Hand-Gesture Recognition system based on mm-wave radars, efficient spatial and temporal Convolutional Neural Networks and an energy-optimized hardware design. ü§ñüì°‚úã
The hardware implementation is based on our miniaturized wearable platform [VitalCore](https://github.com/ETH-PBL/VitalCore).

The dataset used in this work is available for download from ETH Library at [this link](https://www.research-collection.ethz.ch/handle/20.500.11850/672242). More information on the data format and relative licence can be found in the link above.

## Getting Started

To start using TinyssimoRadar:

1. Set up a Python environment with pip installed.
2. Create a virtual environment using `virtualenv` or `venv`:
   ```
   virtualenv venv
   ```
   or
   ```
   python3 -m venv venv
   ```

3. Activate the virtual environment:
   ```
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

4. Install the required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

5. Run TinyssimoRadar
   ```
   pyhon -m main.py train quantize evaluate
   ```

   Several model parameters are availabe, get more information via --help
   ```
   python main.py --help
   ```
